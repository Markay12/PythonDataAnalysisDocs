What is data analysis?  
- Data analysis involves exploring, representing and understanding data. Whether this is large amounts of data (big data) or small amounts such as a local project, data anaylsis can be conducted in many forms.

One major use of data analysis comes with *machine learning* which is a

This uses data we have found to create models that can predict values or future outcomes

Data that is collected from this analysis can be used in many situations that benefit the greater public by finding the best ways to teach and accomodate to others. By learning the best methods of everyday tasks we can better optimize our lives.


## Data Analysis - First Dive

Analysis of data is usually done in what is called an *iterative* process which allows the scientist to analysis and test hypotheses along the way learning from what they are collecting

Their main concern is with finding ways to explore, visualize and manipulate the data they are given. Finding the best way to represent this data can lead to better results and a stronger understanding
